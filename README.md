# create-mahdi-app [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/create-mahdi-app.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mahdi-app)

A CLI tool to create Next.js projects with Mahdi's preferred tech stack.

## About

This is a create app tool for creating Mahdi's flavor stack applications in both frontend and backend. I was tired of setting up my preferred tech stack again and again, so I gathered everything into a single CLI command. Now you can bootstrap your entire project with all the tools and configurations I use in just one line of code.

## Requirements

Before using this CLI tool, make sure you have one of the following installed:

-   **Bun** (recommended): Install from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh)
-   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher

## Installation

For npm:

```bash
npx create-mahdi-app
```

Or using Bun:

```bash
bunx create-mahdi-app
```

The CLI will guide you through the setup process with interactive prompts.
